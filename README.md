# Project Euler Repository

Project Euler is a website dedicated to the presentation of intriguing problems which combine mathematical insight and computer coding. It provides a system where people can make an account, attempt the problem and try and submit a solution.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the code I have written for Project Euler over the years. Note that some of it was written a **LONG** time ago and so the code may be a bit rough in places and not use the best variable naming or code conventions.

My user name was **thingamabob** and previously to 2017 I had solved 59 of the released 575 problems.

# Requirements and Setup

To play around with this repository, use the command:

`git clone https://github.com/simon-mcmahon/project-euler.git` in the directory you wish to copy the files.

The version of python used is mainly **python 2.7** in the directory **old-python-scripts** due to the age of the code and **python 3.X** elsewhere.

## Understanding the directories

| Directory or Sub-Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
|old-python-scripts | Contains all of the python code written before 2017. Will definitely require python 2.7 to run. |
|   ⟶ WIP | Home to the work in progress python scripts which I did not get around to completing. |
|   ⟶ [number] | My solution to some problems such as 22 or 42 required multiple .py files so these have their own sub-folder.|
|   ⟶ [number].py | The python code which solves the relevent Project Euler problem either by printing the correct answer or defining a variable equals it. |
|new-python-scripts | Folder containing all problems attempted in or after the year 2017. |
|   ⟶ WIP | Home to the work in progress python scripts which I did not get around to completing. |
|   ⟶ [number].py | The python code which solves the relevent Project Euler problem either by printing the correct answer or defining a variable equals it. |
